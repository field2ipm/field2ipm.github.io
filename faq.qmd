::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Are meals provided?

Yes, meals will be provided during the workshop. Please see [Dining at RMBL](https://www.rmbl.org/visit-rmbl/dining-hall/).

## What are the lodging accommodations?

The workshop fee includes on-site lodging in cabins at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab. RMBL is built from the remains of a late 1800’s silver-mining town. Most participants will be staying in renovated but rustic cabins built in the 1960’s through 1990’s. See [here](https://www.rmbl.org/field-station-info/housing/) for more information.

## Travel & Packing

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## How do I get to the workshop?

<!-- The Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) is located in the town of Gothic which is about 30 minutes from Crested Butte and a \~5 hour drive from the Denver airport. -->

<!-- We recommend flying through Denver and taking the intercity bus to Crested Butte. Book your flight to arrive before 11am Mountain Time. A light rail train runs directly from Denver International Airport to the Union Station bus terminal (\~45 min duration). The bus station is belowground, and the Bustang Outrider line to Gunnison departs from the middle of the concourse around door ##. The bus departs Denver Union Station at 1:45pm and arrives to Crested Butte at 7:35pm. -->

<!-- Workshop organizers will pick up participants from Crested Butte and take them up to Gothic/RMBL. -->
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Can I arrive a bit early or stay a bit later?

Most likely yes, but you will need to arrange a longer stay with RMBL staff.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## I see an airport that looks closer than Denver. Can I book my flights through there?

Commercial flights are available into Gunnison, which is about 1 hour away from RMBL. The high mountain setting of this airport causes frequent flight cancellations in summer. This region experiences strong monsoonal thunderstorms. Modestly high temperatures also cause cancellations because the already low air density falls below the minimum needed for airplanes to takeoff and land. **We consider flights through Gunnison to be unreliable** if you need to travel on a specific date or want to avoid unexpected hotel stays en route.

**Aspen is is not a viable alternative despite being very close to Gothic** (\<20 air miles / \<30 km). The intervening terrain is very rugged Wilderness with high mountain passes with no direct road route. The shortest safe road route around these mountains takes 4-5 hours (\>100 miles / \>160 km, about 1/3 of that on dirt roads), and there is no mass transit option.

## Diversity, Community, Health & Safety

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## How high is the elevation, and how should I prepare?

Gothic, CO sits at 9,600 ft (2900 m) above sea level. Most people coming from low elevation experience mild symptoms from the reduced availability of oxygen. Best practices include hydrating well and getting enough sleep before and immediately after arriving to high elevation. Consider reducing or avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Individuals who anticipate a harder time adjusting to elevation may consider ascending slowly by arriving to Denver a few days early before ascending to Gothic.

The [CDC offers more detailed guidance to high elevation travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).
