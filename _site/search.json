RMBL is built from the remains of a late 1800’s silver-mining town. Most participants will be staying in renovated but rustic cabins built in the 1960’s through 1990’s.

Can I book my flights through there?\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial flights are available into Gunnison, which is about 1 hour away from RMBL. The high mountain setting of this airport causes frequent flight cancellations in summer. This region experiences strong monsoonal thunderstorms. Modestly high temperatures also cause cancellations because the already low air density falls below the minimum needed for airplanes to takeoff and land. We consider flights through Gunnison to be unreliable if you need to travel on a specific date or want to avoid unexpected hotel stays en route.\nAspen is is not a viable alternative despite being very close to Gothic (&lt;20 air miles / &lt;30 km). The intervening terrain is very rugged Wilderness with high mountain passes with no direct road route. The shortest safe road route around these mountains takes 4-5 hours (&gt;100 miles / &gt;160 km, about 1/3 of that on dirt roads), and there is no mass transit option."

    "text": "Diversity, Community, Health & Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow high is the elevation, and how should I prepare?\n\n\n\n\n\nGothic, CO sits at 9,600 ft (2900 m) above sea level. Most people coming from low elevation experience mild symptoms from the reduced availability of oxygen. Best practices include hydrating well and getting enough sleep before and immediately after arriving to high elevation. Consider reducing or avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Individuals who anticipate a harder time adjusting to elevation may consider ascending slowly by arriving to Denver a few days early before ascending to Gothic.\nThe CDC offers more detailed guidance to high elevation travel."
