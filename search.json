    "text": "Cost, Housing & Dining\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow much does the workshop cost?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workshop fee is $720, which includes on-site lodging and all meals in the dining hall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipIs financial support available?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have funding from the National Science Foundation to provide tuition and travel support for a limited number of participants. To allow us to maximize participation, we ask that you make an effort to self-fund your participation if possible, be it from your PI’s grants, your home institution’s resources, or other funding sources (e.g., the American Society of Naturalist’s regional conference and workshop travel grants, Sigma Xi, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAre meals provided?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, meals will be provided during the workshop. Please see Dining at RMBL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat are the lodging accommodations?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workshop fee includes on-site lodging in cabins at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab. RMBL is built from the remains of a late 1800’s silver-mining town. Most participants will be staying in renovated but rustic cabins built in the 1960’s through 1990’s. See here for more information."

    "section": "Travel & Packing",
    "text": "Travel & Packing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow do I get to the workshop?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) is located in the town of Gothic which is about 30 minutes from Crested Butte and a ~5 hour drive from the Denver airport.\nWe recommend flying through Denver and taking the intercity bus to Crested Butte. Book your flight to arrive before 11am Mountain Time. A light rail train runs directly from Denver International Airport to the Union Station bus terminal (~45 min duration). The bus station is belowground, and the Bustang Outrider line to Gunnison departs from the middle of the concourse around door ##. The bus departs Denver Union Station at 1:45pm and arrives to Crested Butte at 7:35pm.\nWorkshop organizers will pick up participants from Crested Butte and take them up to Gothic/RMBL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCan I arrive a bit early or stay a bit later?\n\n\n\n\n\nMost likely yes, but you will need to arrange a longer stay with RMBL staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipI see an airport that looks closer than Denver. Can I book my flights through there?\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial flights are available into Gunnison, which is about 1 hour away from RMBL. The high mountain setting of this airport causes frequent flight cancellations in summer. This region experiences strong monsoonal thunderstorms. Modestly high temperatures also cause cancellations because the already low air density falls below the minimum needed for airplanes to takeoff and land. We consider flights through Gunnison to be unreliable if you need to travel on a specific date or want to avoid unexpected hotel stays en route.\nAspen is is not a viable alternative despite being very close to Gothic (&lt;20 air miles / &lt;30 km). The intervening terrain is very rugged Wilderness with high mountain passes with no direct road route. The shortest safe road route around these mountains takes 4-5 hours (&gt;100 miles / &gt;160 km, about 1/3 of that on dirt roads), and there is no mass transit option."

    "text": "Diversity, Community, Health & Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow high is the elevation, and how should I prepare?\n\n\n\n\n\nGothic, CO sits at 9,600 ft (2900 m) above sea level. Most people coming from low elevation experience mild symptoms from the reduced availability of oxygen. Best practices include hydrating well and getting enough sleep before and immediately after arriving to high elevation. Consider reducing or avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Individuals who anticipate a harder time adjusting to elevation may consider ascending slowly by arriving to Denver a few days early before ascending to Gothic.\nThe CDC offers more detailed guidance to high elevation travel."
